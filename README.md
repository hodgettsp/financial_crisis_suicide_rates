# An Analysis of the Effects of The 2007-2009 Financial Crisis on Suicide Rates in the United States

Using a differences in differences approach, the effects of the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis on suicide rates in people
of investing age was examined. An initial analysis revealed no significant effects, with gender and age accounting for
variation in suicide rates. A differences in differences in differences model revealed a minorly significant correlation
between suicides for males of investing age and the Financial Crisis. Limitations and ethical concerns are discussed
regarding model and dataset designs.
